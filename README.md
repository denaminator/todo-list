# todo-list
Simple to-do list project I made in Java as practice to learn more about Java GUIs and actual code applications. I followed a Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQXjF7tw_MQ&pp=ygUPdG8gZG8gbGlzdCBqYXZh) for the project basis.

Instead of using a for loop to parse through the Components, I tried using ArrayLists to update the task numbers (listItems, an ArrayList of Task objects, to contain all created tasks) and denote if the tasks are complete or not (isChecked, a boolean ArrayList of the same size, to denote the boolean value of each task's checked status).

I also customized the color scheme of the overall frame and its components using the RGB values of colors I selected on a color picker site.
